# Hi, I'm Romain :wave:

I'm a Software Engineer working in C++ library development around Europe. For the past year, I have been developing [wheelcc](https://github.com/romainducrocq/wheelcc), an optimizing C compiler written from scratch for x86-64 Linux. Before that, I worked on multiple topics related to AI, like Neuroevolution and Reinforcement Learning. I also have experience in C and Python (I use Debian btw). Have fun checking out some of my repos!
