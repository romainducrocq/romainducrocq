# Hi, I'm Romain :wave:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romainducrocq/romainducrocq/master/header.png" alt="header" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">

I'm a CS grad engineering student with a double major in Intelligent Systems and Project Management. 
From machine learning to autonomous agents, I'm passionnate about everything related to AI, and have written my master thesis on deep reinforcement learning. 
Yet, what I do like even more than ML is learning new things : I'm always curious to delve into new technologies, concepts and projects !
Lately, I've been playing around a lot with Python, but I also have a soft spot for C++, Javascript and Bash.  
  

_My day-to-day work environment : Linux Debian Xfce | Tmux | Nano, Atom | Pycharm, IntelliJ, CLion._  
  
Here are some of my projects :  

## My projects

### Reinforcement learning
- **<u>frameworQ</u>** - **[Python, Pytorch, Tensorboard, Msgpack, OpenAi Gym]** Framework to easely create or bind RL environments and train / test agents with deep Q-learning algorithms : DQN, double DQN, Dueling DDQN, 3DQN with prioritized replay. (The user wraps a Markov Decision Process <state/action/reward - functions> and the environment in MVC boilerplates ; then tunes the hyper-parameters and Q-network from a configuration file.) | in Python with Pytorch ML prototyping, Tensorboard learning curve visualization, Msgpack model saving and loading, and OpenAi Gym multi-processing learning.
