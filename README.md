# Hi, I'm Romain :wave:

I'm a CS grad engineering student with a double major in Intelligent Systems and Project Management. 
From machine learning to autonomous agents, I'm passionnate about everything related to AI, and have written my master thesis on deep reinforcement learning. 
Yet, what I do like even more than ML is learning new things : I'm always curious to delve into new technologies, concepts and projects !
Lately, I've been playing around a lot with Python, but I also have a soft spot for C++, Javascript and Bash.  
  
Here are some of my projects :

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. In 2020, I was selected to be an inaugural <a href="https://stars.github.com/">GitHub Star ðŸŒŸ</a> based on my involvement in the tech community.  My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://www.meetup.com/React-Ladies/">React Ladies</a>, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
