# Hi, I'm Romain :fish_cake:

****

I'm a Software Engineer working in C++ library development in Riga, Latvia, with an interest in C/C++ programming, Unix and compilers.  
Right now, I am developing [wheelcc](https://github.com/romainducrocq/wheelcc), an optimizing C compiler written from scratch in ISO C17 for x86-64 GNU/Linux and MacOS, as well as a new C-like programming language based on this compiler (still in private for now). Before that, I worked on multiple topics related to AI, like Neuroevolution and Reinforcement Learning, mostly in Python and C++. Oh, and I use Debian stable btw.  
Have fun checking out some of my repos!
