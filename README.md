# Hi, I'm Romain :fish_cake:

****

I'm a C and C++ Software Engineer working in Riga, Latvia, with an interest in Unix systems and compilers.  
Right now, I am developing [wheelcc](https://github.com/romainducrocq/wheelcc), an optimizing C compiler written from scratch in C for x86-64 Linux and MacOS, as well as a [planet](https://github.com/romainducrocq/planet) C-like programming language based on this compiler. Before that, I worked on multiple topics related to AI, like Neuroevolution and Reinforcement Learning, mostly in Python and C++. Oh, and I use Debian stable btw.  
Have fun checking out some of my repos!
